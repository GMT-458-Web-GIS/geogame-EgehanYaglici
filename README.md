### Read Me First! ðŸ˜Š
The **final version** of the game has removed the **'Energy'** mechanic and introduced the **'Dice Roll'** system, which adds a layer of randomness and strategy. The dice roll mechanic includes **25 different effects**, impacting attack, defense, range, and health. 

The **Current Status** section was also added to track unit health, attack power, and range, providing players with crucial information during gameplay. 

**Note:** 
- Not included the final versionâ€™s screenshots here since the game is available to play live via a link. Instead, we retained the initial design's demo images below to compare the final implementation with its conceptual design. 
- The differences highlight the design changes made during development.

DESIGN And DEMO GAME PART FROM FIRST PART
---
## Design of the Geo-Game 

---
### Read me first :)
**Actually, I had already designed the geogame part in my head before I designed it here, and I had already written more than half of it before the first commit. The purpose of doing this here was to test how much I could actually translate what I thought into code, because my experience in scripting in JS was not as advanced as in python. Since I was able to achieve most of what I wanted, you can see the design below. If I didn't succeed you would probably see an easier puzzle game, but I guess we'll never learn :D**

### Requirements and Layout

#### Game Objective
The game is a geo-based strategy game where players purchase and mobilize units on a map, move them for a cost and that means energy in the game, to achieve a high score by strategically defeating defense units positioned on the map.
